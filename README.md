# Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/).
# Background
The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data analyst job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousseâ€™s [Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/courses). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?
# Tools I Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQLiteViz (https://sqliteviz.com):** SQLiteViz was used as a visual SQL editor and lightweight SQLite database interface for query testing and analysis.(To get familiar with the data)
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing
my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query in this project was focused on exploring particular aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I went about answering each question:
